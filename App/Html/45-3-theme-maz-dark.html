            As a highly skilled Executive Chef, I read your posting for a new Executive Chef with interest. My experience aligns well with the qualifications you are seeking at Matthieu's Famille Restaurant, in particular my role as an Executive Chef at Chez Friso, and I am certain I would make a valuable addition to your organization.
            <br><br>
            With more than 10 years' experience as an Executive Chef, I am adept in employee supervision, team leadership, and time management. Moreover, while my on-the-job experience has afforded me a well-rounded skill set, including first-rate communication and motivational skills, I excel at:
            <br><br>
            Budgeting and cost analysis<br>
            Menu planning<br>
            Hiring and training<br>
            Team building<br>
            Quality control inspections
            <br><br>
            In addition to my experience and personal qualities, I have a solid educational foundation and a passion for international cuisine, specifically French and Italian. I am extremely enthusiastic about Matthieu's Famille Restaurants' focus on L'apÃ©ritif, and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your continued success.
            <br><br>
